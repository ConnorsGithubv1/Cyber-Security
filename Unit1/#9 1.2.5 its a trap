PLTW COMPUTER SCIENCE NOTEBOOK

Firewall Rules: How will you disable Windows file sharing? Are there other services/ports you need to disable?
Suspicious files: How can you identify suspicious files? 
Downloaded files: How will you know where to look for files downloaded from the internet?
Lost/deleted user files: Where will you find your friend’s “deleted” files?
Suspicious processes: How will you determine suspicious processes and what will you do with them?


Thoroughly document how you found and how you fixed each problem. Take screenshots for each of the step of your action plan (a through e) to help you explain what you did. Another team should be able to read your notes and perform the same tasks you did to secure the computer.
Use the Activities folder on the Desktop as part of your investigation.
Next to each “fix” that you documented, note which Cybersecurity Lifecycle activity you performed. Some fixes or tasks may fall into more than one category.
Describe anything you learned from your cyber team.
