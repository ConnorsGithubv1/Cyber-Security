Automatically opening a file that contains malicious software can cause the malware to be installed and/or executed on your computer. Rather than double-clicking a file that you are not familiar with, use the right-click menu to view or to edit a file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.bat -runs a script in cmd
.doc -shows a document file
.txt -a plain text file
.jpg -image
.html -website

Always show filename extensions and check them before you open a file.

As the user or administrator of a computer, you should know the other legitimate users; suspicious users can create suspicious files.

Describe how the file system features of “double-extensions”, hiding, and encryption can be used for both safe and malicious purposes.

double extensions can open up unwanted files that can possible harm your computer. They are hidden in double extensions so it would be hard to even tell it was there.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you keep a record of the installation dates of your installed applications, you can use the file’s Date modified property to find applications that you did not install, indicating they might be malware.

Searching for executable scripts can help you find suspicious files.
