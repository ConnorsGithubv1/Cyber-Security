* How could these settings help safeguard personal information?

    By setting you computer to shut off after a period of time without use, lessen the time frame for people to hack into your computer. Making it ultimately safer for information.

* Record other file extension types that you know along with the application that uses them. 
    
    .py = pyhton .txt = text file .java = java file .html = html file .css = css file

* Algorthim     password     guesses    time

* Compare how long it took to search a one-word password and a one-word-with-a-symbol password. How many times longer did take?
    
    It took longer and way more guesses to crack a password with a word and a symbol then with just a one word password.

* Comparing runs that used beginning-of-the-dictionary words, calculate how many times longer the two-word algorithm took than the one-word-and-a-symbol algorithm.
    
    it took 0.00800000 longer

* Does the time difference indicate the two-word password is stronger or weaker than the one-word-with-a-symbol password?
    
    A two word password is stronger then a password with a symbol.

* What could further improve a password?

    Numbers and more words can improve the password even more and make it harder to be cracked.

* Summarize why a passphrase like Purple#Hopscotch&is4me is better than purplehopscotch. Look back over your data and explain your answer in terms of the data you collected.
    
    Purple#Hopscotch&is4me is a better password because it contains more words and symbols then purplehopscotch and would be way harder to crack.

* How do you think CAPTCHAs are an effective way to distinguish between an automated program and a human?

    Because algorithms cant solve answers that are inside a picture. So an algorthim could not run with a captcha.

Conclusion:

* In which part of the Cybersecurity Lifecycle would you place authorization and authentication?

    You would find authorization and authentication under protecting your assests.

* Using a tool such as the password cracking algorithm to discover someone elseâ€™s password is almost always ethically wrong and in most cases illegal. Describe what you think an ethical use of the tool might be.

    An ethical hacking would maybe be finding a password to an old system that hasn't been in use and the password is unkown.
