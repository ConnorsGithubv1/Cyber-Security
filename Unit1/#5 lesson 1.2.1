types of malware and how they spread to network devices:

virus - Software that is spread by people, specifically user actions, usually through emails, websites, and chats. A virus infects your computer, causing a wide variety of problems.

worm - Similar to a virus except that a worm does not need a human to spread, rather it can replicate on its own to infect other computers.

backdoor - Malicious software that bypasses the normal, secure, or restricted access.

spyware - Software that secretly collects information about you. It usually resides on a website or in a service such as your email program.

Trojan horse - A malicious program disguised as legitimate software. Users intentionally install a Trojan horse, thinking they are installing valid software.

Firewalls are installed between a local area network and any larger network, like the internet.

A firewall application can be installed on a local server, a personal computer, or a computer whose sole purpose is to run the firewall. Even a router can be configured with firewall capabilities. Wherever it is installed, the firewall protects the local area network from malware.
