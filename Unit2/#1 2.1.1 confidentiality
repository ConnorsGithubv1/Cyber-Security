    Activity 2.1.1
What is the CIA Triad?
confidentiality integratity and availability

Define the Confidentiality component of CIA and list some ways of protecting it.

encryption
making sure only sender and user can see message

Define the Integrity component of CIA and list some ways of protecting it.

Ensure data is never tampered with

Define the Availability component of CIA and list some ways of protecting it.

Draw one CIA triangle for one of the items and explain your reasoning.

Social security number


Confidentiality - Social security can be used to take peoples identity, so that information must stay encrypted and only the user and the reciever get the encrypt key

Integrity -  data is protected from unauthorized changes to ensure that it is reliable and correct

Availabiltiy - authorized users have access to the systems and the resources they need

Things to Consider
Confidentiality
Who should have access to view each data category: internal users (Employee), external users (Customer), or both? 
Does the data require encryption? Why or why not? (Recall that encryption can be used for sensitive and personal information.)
Integrity
Who should have access to modify the data: internal users (Employee), external users (Customer), or both?
Availability
What level of availability does this data require? Why?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can reduce the risk of exposing your data to risk and vulnerabilities by logically and/or physically separating categories of data. For example, you can physically separate website data used by the public from internal company information by placing them on different computers.

Using tools such as Disconnect and HTTPS Everywhere (from Unit 1) you can control aspects of your own personal CIA triad.
